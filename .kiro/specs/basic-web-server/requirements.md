# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a collaborative pixel canvas web application using Leptos CSR and WebSocket technology. Users can draw black or white pixels on a shared canvas that updates in real-time for all connected users, similar to the "1 million checkboxes" concept but with pixels. The focus is on creating small, manageable code modules that follow Rust naming conventions and best practices, using the latest Leptos packages with Trunk for building.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a pixel canvas in my browser, so that I can draw on a shared collaborative surface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a pixel canvas (e.g., 100x100 pixels)
2. WHEN the canvas renders THEN the system SHALL show each pixel as either black or white
3. WHEN the canvas is displayed THEN the system SHALL be visually clear and responsive
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load the current canvas state from the server

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on pixels to change their color, so that I can draw on the collaborative canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a white pixel THEN the system SHALL change it to black
2. WHEN I click on a black pixel THEN the system SHALL change it to white
3. WHEN I change a pixel THEN the system SHALL immediately update the visual display
4. WHEN I change a pixel THEN the system SHALL send the update to the server via WebSocket

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates from other users, so that I can collaborate on the same canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user changes a pixel THEN the system SHALL update my canvas in real-time
2. WHEN I connect to the application THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection
3. WHEN the WebSocket receives pixel updates THEN the system SHALL apply them to the canvas immediately
4. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular component organization, so that I can easily understand and maintain the Leptos application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the codebase THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules (canvas, websocket, pixel, types)
2. WHEN creating modules THEN the system SHALL follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for files/functions, PascalCase for components and types)
3. WHEN structuring the project THEN the system SHALL use separate files for each major component
4. WHEN defining modules THEN the system SHALL use proper visibility modifiers (pub/private)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper WebSocket message handling, so that pixel updates are reliable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending pixel updates THEN the system SHALL use structured message format (JSON with x, y, color)
2. WHEN receiving messages THEN the system SHALL validate message format before processing
3. WHEN WebSocket errors occur THEN the system SHALL log helpful error messages
4. WHEN handling messages THEN the system SHALL use Rust's Result type for error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want connection status feedback, so that I know if my changes are being synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to WebSocket THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status
2. WHEN disconnected from WebSocket THEN the system SHALL display "Disconnected" status
3. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL display "Reconnecting..." status
4. WHEN connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI indicator immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be easily buildable and testable, so that I can quickly iterate on the collaborative features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `trunk serve` THEN the system SHALL start the Leptos development server
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL compile without warnings
3. WHEN testing WebSocket functionality THEN the system SHALL work with a local WebSocket server
4. WHEN making code changes THEN the system SHALL hot-reload in the browser
