# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up basic Leptos CSR "Hello World" application
  - Configure Cargo.toml with latest Leptos CSR dependencies
  - Create Trunk.toml configuration file
  - Set up basic HTML template and main.rs with "Hello World" component
  - Create modular directory structure (src/components/, src/types/, src/services/)
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` shows "Hello World" in browser
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 7.1_

- [ ] 2. Create stylish pixel grid UI in center of screen
  - Build Canvas component that renders a visible 50x50 pixel grid
  - Style each pixel as recognizable squares with borders (10px x 10px)
  - Center the grid on screen with attractive styling
  - Add title "Collaborative Pixel Canvas" above the grid
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` shows centered, stylish pixel grid
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Add zoom and pan functionality to canvas
  - Implement zoom in/out controls (buttons or mouse wheel)
  - Add pan/drag functionality to move around the canvas
  - Ensure grid remains centered and responsive during zoom/pan
  - Add zoom level indicator and reset button
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` allows zooming and panning the pixel grid
  - _Requirements: 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Enable client-side pixel drawing (temporary local state)
  - Add click handling to toggle pixels between black and white
  - Implement local state management for pixel colors
  - Show immediate visual feedback when pixels are clicked
  - Add clear/reset button to clear the entire canvas
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` allows drawing pixels that persist locally
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Add drag drawing functionality
  - Implement mouse drag to draw continuous lines
  - Show real-time preview while dragging
  - Use line drawing algorithm for smooth lines between drag points
  - Add different drawing modes (single pixel vs line drawing)
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` allows drawing by clicking and dragging
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Create basic WebSocket connection setup
  - Add WebSocket connection to localhost:8080
  - Display connection status indicator (connected/disconnected)
  - Implement basic connection management and auto-reconnect
  - Add simple message sending/receiving (ping/pong for testing)
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` shows connection status and can connect to WebSocket server
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 6.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 7. Implement pixel synchronization via WebSocket
  - Send pixel updates through WebSocket when drawing
  - Receive and apply pixel updates from other users
  - Replace local-only state with server-synchronized state
  - Handle conflicts and ensure consistent canvas state
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` with WebSocket server allows real-time collaborative drawing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Optimize network protocol for efficiency
  - Replace JSON with binary message format
  - Implement line drawing messages for drag operations
  - Add message batching and compression
  - Optimize for minimal network usage during rapid drawing
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` with optimized protocol for smoother collaboration
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 9. Add canvas size configurability and performance optimization
  - Make canvas size configurable (start with 100x100, allow larger)
  - Implement efficient rendering for large canvases
  - Add performance monitoring and optimization
  - Test with different canvas sizes and user counts
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` supports different canvas sizes with good performance
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Add proper error boundaries and graceful failure handling
  - Implement user-friendly error messages and recovery options
  - Add loading states and progress indicators
  - Handle network issues and connection problems elegantly
  - **Runnable**: `trunk serve` handles errors gracefully with helpful user feedback
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_
